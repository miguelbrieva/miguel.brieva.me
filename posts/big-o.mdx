Acording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. It can help us to know if a solution is scalable.

Run this code in a browser now the performance of this function.

```js
const wally = ['Wally']

function whereIsWally(arr) {
  let t0 = performance.now()
  for (let i of arr) {
    i === 'Wally' && console.log('There is Wally!')
  }
  let t1 = performance.now()
  console.log(`The time it took to find him was ${t1 - t0} milliseconds`)
}

whereIsWally(wally)

// There is Wally!
// The time it took to find him was 0.10000000894069672 milliseconds
```

This was a very simple function iterating throw an array of just one element. But what if the array if bigger, for example, with 1k elements. Lets see.
