The for...of statement was introduced in ES6 and is super usefull to iterate over an array in a 'clean' way.

So, having array called `array` with `'a','b','c'` elements.

```javascript
for (let element of array) {
  console.log(element)
}
// expected output:
// "a"
// "b"
// "c"
```

But, what if we need the index.

One solution is to use the `Array.prototype.entries()` method that returns a new array with a key/value pair with the index as key.

```javascript
for (let [index, element] of array.entries()) {
  console.log(index, element)
}
// expected output:
// 0, 'a'
// 1, 'b'
// 2, 'c'
```
