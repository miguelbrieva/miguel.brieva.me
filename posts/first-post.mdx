Hi. This is my first post. The topic I choosed is TypeScript. 

```js
export const getSlugs = (): string[] => {

}
```

The code above is saying that the function will return a.. string? Or an Array of strings?
The answerd is an array of strings.

```js
export const getSlugs = (paths: array): string[] => {
  // some code 
  return [] // an array
}
```

Did you notice the argument? 

How it works in the good and old function of all life?

```js
export function getSlugs(paths: array) {

} 
```
