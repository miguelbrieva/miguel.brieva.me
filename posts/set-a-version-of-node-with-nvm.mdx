When we work with multiple projects, is very common to deal with vesioning problems. If you are working with nodejs, nvm is an excellent solution to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js via command line.

We can know if nvm is installed with the command bellow. If you don't, find [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for instructions on how to do it.

```console
command -v nvm
```

## Usage

To download, and install a specific version of node:

```console
nvm install v14.14.0 # or v16.3.0
```

To set a default version:

```console
npm alias default v14.14.0
```

You can check the documentation [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
